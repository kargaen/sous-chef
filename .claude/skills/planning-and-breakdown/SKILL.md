name: planning-and-breakdown
description: Use this skill before the first edit of a run that will change more than one file or introduce new behavior, and whenever a request has more than one part. Produces a short plan — mostly what, briefly why — and, when a task benefits from splitting, a checkbox breakdown of at most five parts, ordered top to bottom, each one file and one layer. Do not use for read-only requests, questions, or single-line edits whose plan is obvious. Do not use to plan work an epic already planned — that is epic-implementation — or work a triage verdict already scoped — that is direct-slice.

# Planning and Breakdown

State the plan before the first edit. Then edit.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

**Required:** the request.
**If missing:** nothing to plan. Ask.

**Waivable by explicit instruction:** the breakdown, when the user says the task is one step.
**Not waivable:** the plan precedes the first edit. A plan written afterwards is a summary.

## The plan

Roughly 80% what, 20% why. The *why* exists to let the user catch a wrong premise before code
is written, not to justify the approach.

```md
Plan:
- <what>, in `<file>`, because <the premise you are relying on>
- <what>, in `<file>`
```

Name the file. A plan that does not name files cannot be checked against its scope tier,
which makes it decoration.

If the plan depends on an assumption you cannot verify, stop and ask instead. That is cheaper
than a plan built on it.

## When to break down

Break down when the request has more than one part, or when the plan has more than one file.
Do not break down a single obvious edit — the ceremony costs more than it saves.

- **At most five parts.** More than five means the task is an epic; hand the breakdown to
  `epic-formulation` as the stub.
- **Top to bottom.** Dependency order, never convenience order.
- **One file per part.** A part spanning files is not a part.
- **One layer per part.** `ARCHITECTURE.md` declares the layer model.

```md
Breakdown:
[ ] 1. <verb> <what> in `<file>` — done when <condition>
[ ] 2. ...
```

Each part needs a *done when*. Without it, the part cannot terminate and neither can the run.

## Stop instead of planning

- The breakdown needs more than five parts → `epic-formulation`, breakdown as stub.
- Every ordering you try requires two files to keep the code working — the parts are not
  separable, and the boundary is wrong.
- The plan contradicts `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `rabbit-hole-check`.
- The plan requires a new dependency → `dependency-change`.
- The plan requires a refactor first → `refactor-guard`.

## Then do part one, and only part one

The breakdown is not permission to do all five. Execute the first part, report, stop.
